## Model details

_Basic information about the model._

- Person or organization developing model
- Model date
- Model version
- Model type
- Information about training algorithms, parameters, fairness constraints or other applied
  approaches, and features
- Paper or other resource for more information
- Citation details
- License
- Where to send questions or comments about the model

## Intended use

_Use cases that were envisioned during development._

### Primary intended uses

### Primary intended users

### Out-of-scope use cases

## Factors

_Factors could include demographic or phenotypic groups, environmental conditions, technical
attributes, or others listed in Section 4.3._

### Relevant factors

### Evaluation factors

## Metrics

_The appropriate metrics to feature in a model card depend on the type of model that is being tested.
For example, classification systems in which the primary output is a class label differ significantly
from systems whose primary output is a score. In all cases, the reported metrics should be determined
based on the modelâ€™s structure and intended use._

### Model performance measures

### Decision thresholds

### Approaches to uncertainty and variability

## Evaluation data

_All referenced datasets would ideally point to any set of documents that provide visibility into the
source and composition of the dataset. Evaluation datasets should include datasets that are publicly
available for third-party use. These could be existing datasets or new ones provided alongside the model
card analyses to enable further benchmarking._

### Datasets

### Motivation

### Preprocessing

## Training data

## Quantitative analyses

_Quantitative analyses should be disaggregated, that is, broken down by the chosen factors. Quantitative
analyses should provide the results of evaluating the model according to the chosen metrics, providing
confidence interval values when possible._

### Unitary results

### Intersectional result

## Ethical considerations

_This section is intended to demonstrate the ethical considerations that went into model development,
surfacing ethical challenges and solutions to stakeholders. Ethical analysis does not always lead to
precise solutions, but the process of ethical contemplation is worthwhile to inform on responsible
practices and next steps in future work._

### Data

### Human life

### Mitigations

### Risks and harms

### Use cases

## Caveats and recommendations

_This section should list additional concerns that were not covered in the previous sections._
